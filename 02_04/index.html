    <!-- 
       Inside index.html, you need to tell the browser, first of all there are two files now.
       And second of all, these two files on our modules, they may rely on each other and
       it's important that they're both loaded before things work properly.
       Interestingly, when you set the type attributes to module, both of these automatically get deferred.
       So they will only run after everything else has happened to ensure that the browser has
       all the modules available before anything gets rendered out.
