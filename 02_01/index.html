        <h1>Inline JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
          You can write JavaScript directly inside an HTML document using the
          <code>script</code> element. The element can be added in the
          <code>head</code> section or inside the <code>body</code> element.
        </p>
      </div>
    </main>

    <!-- 
      So when the browser encounters a script tag, it says, "Stop all rendering, 
      I need to see what's going on here." And then reads all the JavaScript, 
      renders the JavaScript and then goes back to rendering the entire page. 
      That's important because if the JavaScript is trying to do something to something else 
      that's being rendered in the page, it has to be called after the thing has been rendered 
      and in the example here, that's exactly what's happening. This piece of code looks for any 
      instance of the code element and you can see there's some code elements in the HTML here, 
      but if we're going to have the browser find the code elements the browser has to have rendered 
      the code elements first and that means the JavaScript needs to appear after the code elements, 
      which is why the script tag is at the bottom of the document. 
      Having settled this, what you're seeing here is an anti-pattern. 
     -->

    <script>
      const allCode = document.querySelectorAll("code");

      for (let item of allCode) {
        item.innerHTML = `&lt;${item.innerHTML}&gt;`;
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
